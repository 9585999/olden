# Olden

Olden has been born out of necessity. For more than 2 years I've been using MacOS as my primary
OS and I got used to a lot of MacOS specific tools and apps. One of those apps was CopyClip 2, which
is an amazing clipboard manager, and for months I couldn't imagine my life without it, but not long ago
things have changed. I was forced to work on Windows and I had to adopt to the new setup.

Don't get me wrong, I really like Windows 10, but I miss MacOS specific tools on it. I tried to
find CopyClip 2 alternative, but all Windows clipboard managers are either outdated or too
complicated, or doesn't have the same feel to them as CopyClip does. So I made a decision to build
my own clipboard manager that would work on every platform I might end up working on and so Olden was born.

Olden is built using the amazing Electron package from GitHub and while still in development it has
not only become an important tool for me on Windows but also replaced CopyClip on MacOS.

## Installation

Go to [releases](https://github.com/aigarsdz/olden/releases) section and download the file that fits
your OS. For MacOS it's dmg, for Windows - zip. I haven't provided a Linux package because I need to do more
testing and research on it, but it will be available in the next minor release. I also haven't made a Windows
installer because it requires a code signing certificate, so I postponed it for a while. I will add
it alongside auto updater at some point.

**Important.** On Linux you need libappindicator1 package to be installed (at least on Ubuntu 16.04.1)
in order for tray icon to work.

## Usage

I have borrowed a lot from CopyClip. Right now you can open it using `Alt+Space` keyboard shortcut.
Use left/right keys to navigate through the history, up/down keys to highlight a specific item and
enter key to select it. Type in the search field to look for specific items in the clipboard history.

A demo is coming soon.Â Â Â 

## Development

You will have to have Node and NPM installed in order to develop Olden.

In most of Node projects you can just run `npm i` to install all the dependencies, but the
project structure of Olden is a bit more complicated and it uses 2 package.json files, therefore,
to set everything up in the correct way, run `npm run bootstrap`.

When you're done making your changes to the project, run `npm run build` to copy all the necessary
files to the app folder and `npm start` to test the app. App packaging is done using npm run `package_macos` for MacOS and
`npm package_win` for Windows or `npm package` for both.

## Icon design

I made all the icons myself, but I am not a designer so their quality is arguable ðŸ˜„. If you're
a designer and you like Olden it would be great if you could contribute by improving those icons
or making new ones.
