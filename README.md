# Olden

Olden has been born out of necessity. For more than 2 years I've been using MacOS as my primary
OS and I got used to a lot of MacOS specific tools and apps. One of those apps was CopyClip 2, which
is an amazing clipboard manager, and for months I couldn't imagine my life without it, but not long ago
things have changed. I was forced to work on Windows and I had to adopt to the new setup.

Don't get me wrong, I really like Windows 10, but I miss MacOS specific tools on it. I tried to
find CopyClip 2 alternative, but all Windows clipboard managers are either outdated or too
complicated, or doesn't have the same feel to them as CopyClip does. So I made a decision to build
my own clipboard manager that would work on every platform I might end up working on and Olden was born.

Olden is built using the amazing Electron package from GitHub and while still in develpment it has
not only become an important tool for me on Windows but also replaced CopyClip on MacOS.
